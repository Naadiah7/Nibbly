# Nibbly
Dessert Recipe Webapp
by Naadirah Karim 2427389

# Changes made from the design document:
I tried to add gsap to most of the elements in my website but I didn't want to overwhelm the user.

# Recipe Book Page
I decided to combine the 2 wireframes that have the dessert catagories and when search or clicking on a specific dessert onto 1 page as it will allow the user to see the results one time.

# Images & Recipes
Most of the images are the images I took and used for the recipes.
The recipes are recipes I use in my own household. I added 2-3 recipes for each dessert section.

# Apis
I used the free spoonacular API and the free Edamam API.

The speechify Api is used for the whole website for accessibility.
