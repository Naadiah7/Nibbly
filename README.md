# Nibbly
Dessert Recipe Webapp
by Naadirah Karim 2427389

# Changes made from the design document:

# Recipe Book Page
I decided to combine the 2 wireframes that have the dessert catagories. When th user searchs or clicks on a specific dessert onto the user to see the results one time.

# Images & Recipes
Most of the images are the images I took and used for the recipes.
The recipes are recipes I use in my own household. I added 2-3 recipes for each dessert section.

# Apis
I used the free spoonacular API and the free Edamam API for dessert types and recipes

The speechify Api was changed to playHT as the speechify requires ...whereas playHT is more easier to use for text to speech accessibility.

# Gsap Animations
I decides that using drawSVG for the title banner's were more difficult then I thought but to still keep the SVG in my website, I added "floating cookies".

# Reviews & Profile Pic
This requires backend data base.
